This was my first minigame, also to be partially used as a mechanics and architectural template for future ones.

In order to reduce scope and actually finish and publish it, I gave myself a ~ two month period to finish.

# Summary
xx is a simple 3d low poly plataformer. The core game loop is a partially procedural endless runner around evolving player abilities.

## Main Features:  
- Basic UI (Main menu, Pause, debug, hud)
- Skills: Multi jump, ground/air dash, feather fall, teleport
- Jump cutting, coyote time, knockback
- AI (GOAP and visual detection system)
- Basic sound system
- Checkpoint and collectibles
- Chunk based procedural level generation (Handcrafted chunks)
- Simple core system

<!-- TODO When finish doc as code, update this -->
### Project architecture
Uses modular approach for future proofing, relying heavily on composition and inheritance when appropriate. Any complex system is documented in `docs/diagrams/`.

Uses conventional commit messages that are fed into git-cliff to auto generate changelog. Has a few CI checks locally and on Github, also pushes to Gitlab. Has a few custom unit tests after execution.

Strictly follows [Godot's recommended code style guidelines](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html) and file naming.

<!-- TODO Finish this (Make it friendly for first time developers) -->
